## About

We're doing peer programming in Rust with Google Gemini. I'm driving and Gemini is typing.

The task was that I only use prompts asking Gemini to do all code changes, and I didn't do a single, 
even smallest change by hand myself. That is the reason why code may contain some business logic issues
like e.g. market being ARBTC/BTC.

I also asked Gemini to produce Scala version of the code.
